## What is this?

This is a small library which downloads all GitHub users given a city. Original idea is [Top-GitHub-Users-Data](https://github.com/JJ/top-github-users-data) by [@JJ](https://github.com/JJ), an adaptation of [top-github-users](https://github.com/paulmillr/top-github-users) from [@paulmillr](https://github.com/paulmillr/).

## What I can do with this?

For the time being you can only get all usernames for a city (with a
city in the location field). In the future, this will be an amazing library.

## What I need to run this?

You will need to install Python 3. Python 2 is not supported. I recommend you [install Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/).

In addition, you will need to get an ID and Secret from GitHub. [You can register your own application here!](https://github.com/settings/applications/new).

#### Dependences

There is a ``requirements.txt`` file. Install all dependences with ``pip install -r requirements.txt``.


## Getting started
#### Basic example
```python
nameCity = "Granada"
GitHubID = "asdadfs5ds8sdfsdf8c"
GitHubSecret = "asdad45asfsdf8vdfg8sdfgv"

city = GitHubCity(nameCity,GitHubID,GitHubSecret)
city.getCityUsers()
```

#### Excluding users

You can generate a JSON file like this (each element is an user and this properties are name -login name of the user- and reason -why this user has been banned-):
```json
[
  {
    "name": "asdpokjdf",
    "reason": "It is only a test"
  },
  {
    "name": "asdfasdf",
    "reason": "It is only a test"
  },
  {
    "name": "asdfasdfadf",
    "reason": "It is only a test"
  }
]
```

When you read this file and parse it to JSON, you can add it to the
class in the constructor:
```python
GitHubCity(nameCity,GitHubID,GitHubSecret, jsonData)
```
