## What is this?
This is a small library which gets all GitHub users given a city. Original idea is [Top-GitHub-Users-Data](https://github.com/JJ/top-github-users-data) by [@JJ](https://github.com/JJ), an adaptation of [top-github-users](https://github.com/paulmillr/top-github-users) from [@paulmillr](https://github.com/paulmillr/).

## What I can do with this?
Now, you only can get all user names from a city (with a city in the location field). In future, this will be an amazing library.

## What I need to run this?
You will need to install Python 3. *Python 2 is not supported*.

In addition, you will need to get ID and Secret from a GitHub application. [You can register your own application here!](https://github.com/settings/applications/new).

#### Dependencies
You have a ``requirements.txt`` file. Install all dependences with ``pip install -r requirements.txt``.

## How to install

There are two options to install this library and its dependencies.

### Install from the source code
You need to clone (or download) this repository. Then, go to ``src`` folder and run:
```shell
python setup.py install
```

### Install from pip

[This library is available to be installed using pip.](https://pypi.python.org/pypi?:action=display&name=githubcity)

```shell
pip install github
```


## Getting started
#### Basic example
```python
idGH = os.environ.get('GH_ID')
secretGH = os.environ.get('GH_SECRET')
configuration = {
   "excludedLocations": [],
   "excludedUsers": [],
   "intervals": [
       [
           "2008-01-01",
           "2015-12-30"
       ]
   ],
   "last_date": "2015-12-30",
   "locations": [
       "Ceuta"
       ],
   "name": "Ceuta"
       }
ciudad = GitHubCity(idGH, secretGH, configuration)
ciudad.calculateBestIntervals()
ciudad.addFilter("repos", ">1")
ciudad.addFilter("followers", ">1")
ciudad.getCityUsers()
```

#### Excluding users
You can generate a JSON file like this (each element is an user and this properties are name -login name of the user- and reason -why this user has been banned-):
```json
[
  {
    "name": "asdpokjdf",
    "reason": "It is only a test"
  },
  {
    "name": "asdfasdf",
    "reason": "It is only a test"
  },
  {
    "name": "asdfasdfadf",
    "reason": "It is only a test"
  }
]
```
